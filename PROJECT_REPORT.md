# AI Legal Contract Analyzer — Project Report

## 1. Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Build an AI-augmented legal contract analyzer and negotiator on Salesforce to streamline contract review, accelerate negotiations, reduce legal risk, and improve compliance.
- **Who benefits**: Enterprises, legal teams, law firms, and freelancers managing high volumes of contracts.
- **Business value**:
  - Automated clause extraction and risk assessment
  - Guided negotiation suggestions
  - Real-time dashboards and notifications
  - Auditability, security, and scalability on Salesforce

## 2. Project Goals & Objectives
- **Automate legal reviews**: Extract and analyze clauses automatically after upload.
- **Improve accuracy**: Standardize risk scoring and clause detection to reduce manual errors.
- **Accelerate negotiations**: Provide AI-generated clause revisions and talking points.
- **Ensure compliance**: Support policy alignment and note compliance considerations (GDPR/CCPA).
- **Visibility & tracking**: Real-time dashboards and audit fields for status, risk, and ownership.
- **Enterprise readiness**: Bulkified triggers, test coverage ≥ 75% (achieved 81%).

## 3. Salesforce Key Features and Concepts Utilized
- **Custom Objects**:
  - `Contract__c`: contract metadata, status, analysis stats.
  - `Clause__c`: clause content, positions, risk details, link to contract.
  - `NegotiationSuggestion__c`: AI suggestions, tone, party goal, confidence.
  - `Status_Change_Event__e`: platform event for notifications.
- **Relationships**:
  - Master-Detail: `Clause__c` → `Contract__c` (cascade delete enforced).
  - Lookups: `Contract__c.Uploaded_By__c` → `User`; `NegotiationSuggestion__c.Requested_By__c` → `User`.
- **Apex Classes**:
  - `ContractAnalysisService`: clause extraction, risk scoring, analysis updates.
  - `AINegotiationService`: AI-style suggestions, confidence scoring, impact.
  - `ContractDashboardController`: exposes dashboard stats and lists to LWC.
  - `StatusNotificationService`: composes and sends email notifications.
- **Apex Triggers**:
  - `ContractStatusTrigger`: notifies on Approved/Rejected.
  - `ClauseStatusTrigger`: notifies on Approved/Rejected.
- **Lightning Web Component**:
  - `contractDashboard`: real-time KPIs, recent contracts, risk distribution.
- **Platform Events**:
  - `Status_Change_Event__e`: future-proofed for async integrations/flows.
- **Validation & Auto-numbering**:
  - Auto numbers: `CT-{00000}`, `CL-{00000}`, `NS-{00000}`.
  - Required fields, picklists for statuses, clause types, risk levels.
- **Testing**: Org-wide Apex coverage: **81%**.

## 4. Detailed Steps to Solution Design
### 4.1 Data Model
- **Contract__c**: Title, Status, Contract Type, Overall Risk Score, Total Clauses, Analyzed Date, Analysis Error, Extracted Text, Uploaded By.
- **Clause__c**: Title, Clause Type, Risk Level, Risk Score, Original/Extracted Text, Start/End Positions, Suggestions, Review metadata, M-D to Contract.
- **NegotiationSuggestion__c**: Clause, Party Goal, Tone, Suggested Text, Explanation, Risk Impact/Change, Confidence, Status, AI Model.
- **Status_Change_Event__e**: Record Id/Type/Name/Title, New Status, Owner Email.

### 4.2 Business Logic
- **Triggers**: Detect status transitions (Approved/Rejected) and delegate to service.
- **Services**:
  - `ContractAnalysisService`: parse text to find clause candidates, compute risk metrics, update parent contract.
  - `AINegotiationService`: produce suggested clause language with explanation and confidence.
  - `StatusNotificationService`: email composition and dispatch to record owners.

### 4.3 User Interface
- **LWC: contractDashboard**
  - KPIs: total contracts, analyzed, pending, high-risk clauses, average risk.
  - Recent contracts list.
  - Risk distribution dataset for charts.
- **Page layouts & Tabs**: Contracts, Clauses, Negotiation Suggestions exposed for navigation.

### 4.4 Automation (Optional but Designed)
- **Flows** (documented, optional):
  - Record-triggered: on status change → notify, publish platform event.
  - Orchestration: post-analysis status management.

### 4.5 Communication Templates
- **Status change emails** (Approved/Rejected): include key fields and guidance.
- **Negotiation suggestion content**: suggested text, rationale, risk impact.

## 5. Testing and Validation
- **Unit Testing**: 4 Apex test classes validating services and controllers.
- **Trigger Validation**: tests cover contract/clause status notification paths.
- **UI Testing**: LWC wiring to Apex verified; component deploys and renders.
- **Integration Testing**: Platform event deploy validated (query not supported by design).
- **Coverage**: Org-wide Apex coverage: **81%**; triggers/services/controllers thoroughly covered.

## 6. Key Scenarios Addressed
- **Contract Risk Assessment**: Extract clauses, compute risk levels/scores, store results.
- **Automated Notifications**: Email on status change; platform event available for async consumers.
- **Negotiation Suggestions**: Generate alternative wording with impact/confidence.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Snapshot KPIs and recent activity for legal teams.

## 7. Reports and Dashboards (Optional)
- Suggested reports:
  - Contract Risk Summary (avg risk by type/status).
  - Clause Distribution by Risk Level.
  - Negotiation Suggestions by Status.
- Suggested dashboard: “Legal Analytics” aggregating the above.

## 8. Conclusion
- **Achievements**:
  - Complete Salesforce-native AI-assisted legal workflow: data model, LWC, triggers, services.
  - Notifications and platform events in place; 81% test coverage.
  - Bulkified, secure, and scalable foundation.
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Deploy LWCs and classes first; align flows with org parser.
  - Prefer Setup-built flows over manual XML in CI for reliability.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Activate documented flows, add permission sets for non-admin roles.
  - Build analytics dashboards; integrate external AI providers.
  - Add queueable/batch analysis for large documents.
