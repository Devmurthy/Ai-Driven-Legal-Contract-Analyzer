# AI Legal Contract Analyzer ‚Äî Salesforce
**Legal Contract Analyzer Project Phases**
**Demo Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w5i1rgb9tVtk8nOL6j1nJtdiVN9K0_jK/view?usp=sharing**
**Phase 1: Project Overview & Requirement Gathering**

Define project purpose and business value

Identify stakeholders and beneficiary users

Outline objectives such as automated clause extraction, risk analysis, AI negotiation, and compliance features

**Phase 2: Data Model Design**
Define custom Salesforce objects: Contract, Clause, NegotiationSuggestion

Establish master-detail relationships and lookups

Configure validation rules and picklists for statuses, risk levels, clause types

**Phase 3: Business Logic Implementation**

Develop Apex classes and services: ContractAnalysisService, AINegotiationService, StatusNotificationService

Implement triggers: ContractStatusTrigger, ClauseStatusTrigger

Automate status updates, risk scoring, AI negotiation suggestions generation

**Phase 4: User Interface & Lightning Web Components (LWC)**

Design and develop LWCs such as contractDashboard to display KPIs and risk charts

Create page layouts and tabs for Contracts, Clauses, Suggestions

Provide a rich, interactive experience for users

**Phase 5: Testing & Validation**

Write comprehensive Apex test classes covering services, triggers, and controllers

Perform UI integration testing (LWC wiring with Apex)

Achieve high org-wide Apex test coverage (81%+)

**Phase 6: Automation & Notifications**

Configure platform events (StatusChangeEvent) for real-time notifications

Develop email templates for status change alerts and negotiation messages

Design record-triggered flows for notifying stakeholders optionally

**Phase 7: Reporting & Dashboards**

Create reports on contract risks, clause distributions, and negotiation statuses

Build dashboards for legal analytics and management overview

**Phase 8: Deployment & Documentation**

Prepare change sets or SFDX deployments

Document architecture, data model, business logic, and user guides

**Phase 9: Future Enhancements Planning**

Plan advanced AI integrations for natural language processing and risk scoring

Consider batch or queueable Apex for large-scale processing

Enhance dashboards with deeper analytics and trend insights

This phased approach covers the end-to-end project lifecycle from requirements to deployment and ongoing improvement for the legal contract analyzer system on Salesforce. Let me know if more details on any phase are needed.

## ADDED: Flows, Platform Events, Email Templates, and Apex Subscribers

### Deploy (Salesforce DX)

```bash
sfdx force:auth:web:login -a legal-analyzer
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/objects/ContractStatusEvent__e
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/objects/ClauseStatusEvent__e
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/email/ContractStatusChange
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/email/ClauseStatusChange
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/classes/ContractStatusEventSubscriber.cls
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/classes/ClauseStatusEventSubscriber.cls
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/flows/Contract_Status_Change.flow-meta.xml
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/flows/Clause_Status_Change.flow-meta.xml

# ADDED: Email Alerts (Workflow) and Reports/Dashboard
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/workflows/Contract__c.workflow-meta.xml
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/workflows/Clause__c.workflow-meta.xml
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/reports/Contracts
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/reports/Clauses
sfdx force:source:deploy -u legal-analyzer -p force-app/main/default/dashboards/Legal_Analyzer_Dashboard.dashboard-meta.xml
```

### Validate

1. Change a `Contract__c.Status__c` and `Clause__c.Status__c` value; confirm emails (sample templates) and debug logs for event subscribers.
2. In Setup ‚Üí Flows, confirm both flows are Active.
3. Check Debug Logs to see `ContractStatusEvent__e` and `ClauseStatusEvent__e` messages from subscriber classes.
4. Open Reports: Contracts by Status and Clauses by Status; confirm data is visible.
5. Open Dashboard: Legal Analyzer Dashboard; confirm both charts render.
6. Email Alerts: confirm the flows reference `ContractStatusChange_Alert` and `ClauseStatusChange_Alert` (defined in Workflow metadata).
7. Permission Set assignment: run `./data/assign-permset.sh -u legal-analyzer -t <user@domain.com>` and login-as target user to verify access to objects and reports.

## ADDED: Validation & Demo

### One-command validation
```bash
chmod +x scripts/validate-deployment.sh data/load-sample-data.sh data/assign-permset.sh
scripts/validate-deployment.sh legal-analyzer
```

What it does:
- Deploys all metadata via `manifest/package.xml`.
- Assigns `Legal_Analyzer_User` permission set.
- Loads sample data (3 Contracts, 5 Clauses).
- Confirms Flows are Active via SOQL on `FlowDefinitionView`.
- Verifies Reports exist.
- Runs Apex tests with coverage.

### Manual checklist (post-deploy)
- Flows Active: Contract_Status_Change, Clause_Status_Change
- Permission Set assigned: Legal_Analyzer_User
- Sample Data loaded: Contracts & Clauses visible
- Emails/Events: status changes send emails and log subscriber debug
- Reports visible: Contracts by Status, Clauses by Status
- Dashboard renders: Legal Analyzer Dashboard (two charts)

## ADDED: CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Create a GitHub Secret `SFDX_AUTH_URL` containing your auth URL (`sfdx auth:web:login --setdefaultusername --setalias ci` then `sfdx auth:sfdxurl:store -f sfdxAuthUrl.txt ...`). Add the URL contents to the secret. The workflow is defined in:

- ADDED: `.github/workflows/salesforce-ci.yml`

What it does:
- Installs Salesforce CLI
- Authenticates using `SFDX_AUTH_URL`
- Runs check-only deploy against `manifest/package.xml`
- Executes Apex tests and enforces 75% org-wide coverage

### Lightning App Page
- ADDED: `force-app/main/default/flexipages/Legal_Analyzer_App.flexipage-meta.xml`
- After deployment, add the page to your app navigation and capture screenshots:
  - Recent Contracts & Clauses
  - Report charts and Dashboard component

## UPDATED: Installation
Package install (once published):
```
https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t000000000000AAA
```

## ADDED: Scratch Org Demo

chmod +x scripts/setup-scratch-org.sh
scripts/setup-scratch-org.sh <dev-hub-alias> legal-analyzer-scratch
```
